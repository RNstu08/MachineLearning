    "# What is Seaborn?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** `Seaborn` is a Python data visualization library based on `Matplotlib`. Its primary goal is to provide a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship with Matplotlib:** `Seaborn` builds directly on `Matplotlib`. You can think of it as making `Matplotlib` easier to use for common statistical plotting tasks and providing better-looking default styles. You'll often use `Matplotlib` functions alongside `Seaborn` to customize plots further.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Aesthetics:** Creates visually appealing plots with sensible defaults.\n",
    "* **Pandas Integration:** Works seamlessly with `Pandas` `DataFrames`, allowing you to easily map `DataFrame` columns to plot aesthetics.\n",
    "* **Statistical Focus:** Has specialized functions designed to visualize statistical relationships, distributions, and comparisons, often including built-in statistical estimation (like confidence intervals or regression lines).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have `Seaborn` installed, you can install it using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install seaborn"
