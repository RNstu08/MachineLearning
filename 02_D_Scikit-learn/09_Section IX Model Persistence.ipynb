    "After spending time training and tuning a machine learning model (or a full `pipeline`), you'll often want to save it so you can reuse it later for making predictions on new data without having to retrain it every time. This process is called model persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Scikit-learn` recommends using the `joblib` library (which is often installed as a dependency of `scikit-learn`) for saving and loading models, as it's generally more efficient for objects containing large `NumPy` arrays. Python's built-in `pickle` module is another option.\n",

    "* **Training a Model:** Briefly trains a sample `Pipeline` for demonstration.\n",
    "* **Saving with `joblib`:** Shows how to use `joblib.dump()` to save the trained pipeline object to a file.\n",
    "* **Loading with `joblib`:** Shows how to use `joblib.load()` to load the pipeline back into memory.\n",
    "* **Verification:** Demonstrates making predictions with the loaded model to ensure it works as expected.\n",
    "* **`pickle` Alternative:** Briefly mentions Python's built-in `pickle` module as another option, noting `joblib`'s preference for `sklearn` objects and security considerations.\n",
