The strength of these connections (synapses) can change over time, which is how learning occurs.\n",

    "        * Updates the weights after processing **each single training instance**.\n",
    "        * **Pros:** Much faster updates. Can escape shallow local minima due to noisy updates. Good for very large datasets and online learning.\n",
    "        * **Cons:** Updates are very noisy, so the loss function can fluctuate significantly. Convergence can be slow and it might not settle precisely at the minimum. Often requires a decreasing learning rate schedule.\n",

    "\n",
    "    1.  **Momentum:**\n",
    "        * **Idea:** Adds a fraction of the previous update vector to the current update vector. This helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. Imagine a ball rolling down a hill; it accumulates momentum and doesn't get easily stuck in small divots.\n",

    "    6.  **AdamW:** A variant of Adam that improves weight decay (L2 regularization) handling, often leading to better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Learning Rate Schedules:**\n",
    "    * Instead of using a fixed learning rate, it's often beneficial to gradually decrease the learning rate as training progresses. This allows for larger steps initially when far from the minimum and smaller, more refined steps as it gets closer, helping to avoid overshooting and settle into a good minimum.\n",
    "    * Common schedules: step decay, exponential decay, 1/t decay, cosine annealing.\n",
