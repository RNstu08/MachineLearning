Here is a list of Model Evaluation Metrics and related concepts.

**The Grand List: Model Evaluation Metrics & Concepts**

**I. Core Concepts & Foundations**

1.  **The Need for Evaluation:** Why simple training accuracy isn't enough (Overfitting, Generalization).
2.  **Train/Validation/Test Splits:** The role of each dataset in the evaluation process.
3.  **Cross-Validation:** Techniques (K-Fold, Stratified K-Fold) and why they provide more robust estimates.
4.  **The Goal Dictates the Metric:** Linking business objectives to metric selection (e.g., minimizing false negatives vs. false positives).

**II. Classification Metrics (Predicting Categories)**

    A. **Based on the Confusion Matrix (Threshold-Dependent)**
        5.  **Confusion Matrix:** (TP, TN, FP, FN) - The absolute foundation. Understanding its components.
        6.  **Accuracy:** Overall correctness (Often misleading, especially with imbalanced data).
        7.  **Precision (Positive Predictive Value):** Reliability of positive predictions.
        8.  **Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate - TPR):** Ability to find all positive instances.
        9.  **Specificity (True Negative Rate - TNR):** Ability to find all negative instances.
        10. **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall (balancing the trade-off).
        11. **False Positive Rate (FPR):** Proportion of negatives incorrectly classified as positive (1 - Specificity).
        12. **False Negative Rate (FNR):** Proportion of positives incorrectly classified as negative (1 - Recall).
        13. **Prevalence:** How often does the positive class actually occur in the sample (`(TP + FN) / Total`)?
        14. **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC):** A balanced metric considering all four confusion matrix entries, useful for imbalance.

    B. **Threshold-Independent Metrics & Curves**
        15. **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve:** Visualizing TPR vs. FPR trade-off across thresholds.
        16. **Area Under the ROC Curve (ROC AUC or AUC):** Single score summarizing ROC performance (probability of ranking positive > negative).
        17. **Precision-Recall (PR) Curve:** Visualizing Precision vs. Recall trade-off across thresholds (better for high imbalance).
        18. **Area Under the PR Curve (PR AUC) / Average Precision (AP):** Single score summarizing PR curve performance.

    C. **Metrics for Probabilistic Predictions**
        19. **Log Loss (Binary Cross-Entropy):** Measures performance based on predicted probabilities, penalizing overconfident wrong predictions.
        20. **Brier Score:** Mean squared error between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes (0 or 1).

    D. **Multi-Class Classification Specifics**
        21. **Averaging Strategies:** Macro, Micro, Weighted averaging for Precision, Recall, F1-score.
        22. **Cohen's Kappa:** Measures agreement between predicted and actual classes, correcting for chance agreement.
        23. **Multi-class Confusion Matrix:** Extension of the binary matrix.

    E. **Utility & Reporting**
        24. **Classification Report (Scikit-learn):** Convenient summary of key metrics per class.

**III. Regression Metrics (Predicting Continuous Values)**

    A. **Error-Based Metrics**
        25. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average absolute difference (robust to outliers, interpretable units).
        26. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average squared difference (penalizes large errors heavily, mathematically convenient).
        27. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of MSE (interpretable units, penalizes large errors).
        28. **Median Absolute Error (MedAE):** Median of absolute differences (highly robust to outliers).
        29. **Max Error:** The largest single prediction error (worst-case scenario).

    B. **Relative Performance Metrics**
        30. **R-squared (R²) - Coefficient of Determination:** Proportion of variance explained by the model.
        31. **Adjusted R-squared:** R² adjusted for the number of predictors (better for model comparison).

    C. **Percentage Error Metrics**
        32. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** Average absolute error as a percentage of the true value (intuitive but problematic with zeros/small values).
        33. **Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE):** An alternative percentage error aiming for symmetry.

**IV. Ranking Metrics (Evaluating Order/Relevance)**

    34. **Mean Average Precision (MAP):** Common in information retrieval/recommendations.
    35. **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG):** Evaluates ranking quality, considering the position and relevance of items.

**V. Clustering Metrics (Evaluating Unsupervised Grouping - Brief Mention)**

    36. **Silhouette Score:** Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
    37. **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI):** Measures similarity between true and predicted clusterings, adjusted for chance.
    38. **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI):** Measures mutual dependence between true and predicted clusterings, normalized.

**VI. Comparing Models & Statistical Significance**

    39. **Statistical Tests on Metrics:** Using techniques like paired t-tests or permutation tests on cross-validation scores to determine if performance differences are statistically significant.
